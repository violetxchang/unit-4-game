Crystal Collector Overview: 
Crystal Collector is a Javascript app that uses the Math.ceil(Math.random() function to generate a random target number between 19 and 120. There are four crystals that are displayed on the screen. The user receives a new target number for each round and each crystal is assigned a new value. The user does not know the crystal’s value until it is clicked on. The user’s goal is to click on the different crystals so that the sum adds up to the target number for that round.
